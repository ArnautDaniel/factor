+ 0.87:

- error popups obscure input area
- callback scheduling issue

+ 0.88:

- lisppaste gui
- browser: tile titles should respond to right-clicks and/or have a
  menu popup button
- growable data heap
- variable width word wrap
- graphical crossref tool
- compiled call traces:
  - should be independent of whenever the runtime was built with
    -fomit-frame-pointer or not
  - doesn't show #labels
  - we don't know if signal handlers run with the same stack or not
- use crc32 instead of modification date in reload-modules
- models: don't do redundant work
- top level window positioning on ms windows
- crashes:
  - httpd crash
  - fep when closing window
- these things are "Too Slow":
  - make-image
  - workspace-window
  - apropos
  - 10000 [ dup number>string ] map describe in the UI
  - available-modules
  - :trace
  - string-lines
  - md5, crc32
- auto-update browser and help when sources reload
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- new windows don't always have focus, eg focus follows mouse
- recompile get/set/>n/n>/ndrop if needed
- cross-word type inference
- ui docs
- some kind of declarative wiring framework for ui
- if we're printing a block on multiple lines, break at some words like
  set off on % # , ... and assembler opcodes
- don't end lines with literals, shuffle words or symbols?
- see should try to not show ; on a line by itself
- IN: on its own line if the entire 'see' form doesn't fit
- command buttons: indicate shortcuts

+ ui:

- browser tool: dropdown menu button for definition operations
- copying pane output
- how do we refer to command shortcuts in the docs?
- editor:
  - autoscroll
  - transpose char/word/line
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- structure editor

+ module system:

- track a list of assets loaded from each module's file
- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- file out

+ compiler/ffi:

- amd64 structs-by-value bug
- %allot-bignum-signed-2 is broken on both platforms
- we may be able to remove the dlsym primitive
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- stdcall callbacks
- callstack overflow when compiling mutually recursive inline words
- test what is done in the case of an invalid declaration on an inline
  recursive
- ppc64 backend
- arm backend
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- C functions returning structs by value
- compiled continuations

+ misc:

- prettyprinter: clean it up
- prettyprinter: don't build entire tree to print first
- automatic help/effects for slot accessors
- tuple shape changes
- should be possible to reload any source file in library
- minor GC takes too long now, we should card mark code heap
- buffer-ptr should be an alien
- swap nappend ==> nappend
- gdb triggers 'multiple i/o ops on port' error
- incremental GC
- UDP
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch

+ httpd:

- remaining HTML issues need fixing
