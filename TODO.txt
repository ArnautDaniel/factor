+ 0.87:

- error popup obscures input area
- cocoa: international keys don't work
- embedded.factor is O(n^2)

+ 0.88:

- models: don't do redundant work
- test factor on linux/ppc
- poorly documented vocabs:
  - alien
  - cocoa
  - command-line
  - compiler
  - completion
  - image
  - interpreter
  - objc
  - optimizer
- grid-lines are rendered incorrectly
- lisppaste gui
- growable data heap
- variable width word wrap
- graphical crossref tool
- inspector where slot values can be changed
- compiled call traces do not work if the runtime is built with
  -fomit-frame-pointer on ppc
- use crc32 instead of modification date in reload-modules
- top level window positioning on ms windows
- these things are "Too Slow":
  - make-image
  - workspace-window
  - apropos
  - 10000 [ dup number>string ] map describe in the UI
  - available-modules
  - string-lines
  - md5, crc32
  - all-words [ word-name ] map prune [ words-named ] map
  - 100000 [ "\"hello\" not" eval drop ] times
- auto-update browser and help when sources reload
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- new windows don't always have focus, eg focus follows mouse
- recompile get/set/>n/n>/ndrop if needed
- cross-word type inference
- some kind of declarative wiring framework for ui
- if we're printing a block on multiple lines, break at some words like
  set off on % # , ... and assembler opcodes
- don't end lines with literals, shuffle words or symbols?
- see should try to not show ; on a line by itself
- IN: on its own line if the entire 'see' form doesn't fit
- command buttons: indicate shortcuts
- how do we refer to command shortcuts in the docs?

+ ui:

- browser tool: dropdown menu button for definition operations
- copying pane output
- editor:
  - autoscroll
  - transpose char/word/line
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- structure editor

+ compiler/ffi:

- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- amd64 structs-by-value bug
- %allot-bignum-signed-2 is broken on both platforms
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- stdcall callbacks
- callstack overflow when compiling mutually recursive inline words
- arm backend
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- C functions returning structs by value
- compiled continuations

+ misc:

- if a word drops the stack pointer below the bottom, then an error
  won't be thrown until the next word accesses the stack
- prettyprinter: don't build entire tree to print first
- automatic help/effects for slot accessors
- tuple shape changes
- should be possible to reload any source file in library
- minor GC takes too long now, we should card mark code heap
- buffer-ptr should be an alien
- swap nappend ==> nappend
- incremental GC
- UDP
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch
