Usage

  USE: lindenmayer setup-window

Towards the end of the "lindenmayer.factor" file, there are words for
various L-systems. Let's pick abop-1, which is an example from the
book The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants

  abop-1

Look at the axiom

  axiom get .

And the productions

  rules get .

The string to be interpreted is stored in the result variable. Start
off by calling init to copy the axiom to result

  init

Look at result

  result get .

It's just the axiom. Now iterate the string

  iterate

You should see a branch and a leaf. Look at the result again:

  result get .

Call iterate as many times as you want. :-) After about 4 iterations
the tree starts to grow beyond the edge of the window. Change the
point that the camera is looking at:

  { 0 0 3 } camera-focus set-global display

You can also change where the camera is located:

  { 0 0 10 } camera-position set-global display

Happy gardening
