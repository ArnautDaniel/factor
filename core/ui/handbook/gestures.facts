"User actions such as keyboard input and mouse button clicks deliver " { $emphasis "gestures" } " to gadgets. If the direct receiver of the gesture does not handle it, the gesture is passed on to the receiver's parent, and this way it travels up the gadget hierarchy. Gestures which are not handled at some point are ignored."

"There are two ways to define gesture handling logic. The simplest way is to associate a fixed set of gestures with a class:"
