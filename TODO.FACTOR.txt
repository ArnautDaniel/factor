- fix this:

  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 
]

- x11: rollover highlight is not reliable
- x11: window positioning not reliable
+ httpd:
  - outliners don't work
  - browser responder doesn't work
- code walker & exceptions -- test and debug problems
- another i/o bug: on factorcode eventually all i/o times out
- x11 title bars are funny
- if the listener is running a command when the image is saved, it
  restores to an unresponsive gadget
- track: don't allow negative dimensions
- fix top level window positioning
- services do not launch if factor not running
- when scrolling wheel, or moving mouse out of window, rollover is not
  updated
- amd64 crash
- get factor running on mac intel
- constant branch folding
- new objc syntax

+ refactor style stack code so that nested styles are handled at a lower-level
  - in HTML, we can nest div tags, etc
  - fix prettyprinter's highlighting of non-leaves looks bad
  - maybe even go from markup to HTML?
    - fix remaining HTML stream issues
    - need to present $list in a useful way
  - better line spacing in ui and html - related issue

+ tabular formatting in UI
  - inspector
    - how does this interact with outliner?
  - $values
  - other help aspects
  - grid layout

+ fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too

+ io:

- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- better i/o scheduler - eg, yield in a loop starves i/o
- "localhost" 50 <client> won't fail

+ help:

- tools section needs updates
- method ordering and interpreter algorithm sections need updates
- document that can <void*> only be called with an alien
- help search
- automatically update help graph when adding/removing articles/words
- document conventions
- new turtle graphics tutorial

+ ui/help:

- x11 input methods
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- clearing pane with ^L leaves scrollbar a pixel off
- new browser:
  - browse generic words and classes
  - need actions for reloading the source file and opening word in jEdit
- toggle/radio buttons/tabs or something
- inspector: less clutter when browsing words
- make-frame should compile
- clicks sent twice
- speed up ideas:
  - only do clipping for certain gadgets
  - use glRect
- reimplement tab completion
- cocoa:
  - horizontal scrolling
  - polish OS X menu bar code
  - dock menu
- display lists
- variable width word wrap

+ compiler/ffi:

- type inference at branch merge points
- free up r11, r12 as a vreg on ppc
- float= on powerpc doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- win64 port
- amd64 %unbox-struct
- complex float type
- complex float intrinsics
- remove literal table
- C functions returning structs by value
- FIELD: char key_vector[32];
- FIELD: union { char b[20]; short s[10]; long l[5]; } data;
- MEMBER: long pad[24];
- C structs: use new-style string mode parsing
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- code gc

+ misc:

- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- make 3.4 bits>double an error
- break: perhaps use current stdio to run break listener
