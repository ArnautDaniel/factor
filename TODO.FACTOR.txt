+ tests:

- java factor: equal numbers have non-equal hashcodes!
- java factor memory leak
- vector=
- sbuf=
- vector-hashcode
- {...} vectors in java factor
- clone-sbuf
- FactorLib.equal() not very good
- test substitute, set-nth, remove-nth
- do nset-nth, nremove-nth, nsubstitute, ninject
- IN: format base: work with all types of numbers
- native float>bits

- tail call optimization broken again
- rethink strhead/strtail&co

+ listener:

- link style lingers
- back space then type: input style gone
- fedit broken with listener
- press enter in the middle of a line

+ native:

- number upgrading errors
- do something about "base" variable -- too fragile
ERROR: I/O error: [ "primitive_read_line_fd_8" "Resource temporarily unavailable" ]
- errors: don't show .factor-rc
- handle division by zero
- fixup-words is crusty
- decide if overflow is a fatal error
- f >n: crashes
- parsing should be parsing
- describe-word
- contains ==> contains?
- telnetd: send errors on socket
- inspector: sort
- accept: return socket, instead of printing msg
- enforce bottom-up in native bootstrap

+ interactive:

- inspector links when describe called without object path
- 'cascading' styles

+ compiler:

- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.

+ misc:

- compiled stack traces broken
- should i -i inf -inf be parsing words?
- namespace clone drops static var bindings
- ditch map
- ditch expand
- set-object-path
- more readable traces

+ httpd:

- httpd: don't flush so much
- log with date
- log user agent
- add a socket timeout
- if a directory is requested and URL does not end with /, redirect
- return more header fields, like Content-Length, Last-Modified, and so on
- HEAD request
- basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
