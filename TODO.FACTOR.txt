+ inference/interpreter:

- word links in stepper
- : bin 5 [ 5 bin bin 5 ] [ 2drop ] ifte ;
- combinator inference
- generic/2generic inference
- type inference
- [ 2 2 . ] run fails
- some way to step over a word in the stepper
- step: print NEXT word to execute, not word that JUST executed
- cache stack effects
- once generic inference is done, can-compile is "has stack effect!"

+ compiler/ffi:

- compiling when*
- compiling each, etc.
- getenv/setenv: if literal arg, compile as a load/store
- inline words
- compiler: drop literal peephole optimization
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types
- compile word twice; no more 'cannot compile' error!
- perhaps /i should work with all numbers
- assembler opcodes dispatch on operand types
- lifting
- save code in image

+ listener/plugin:

- accept multi-line input in listener
- don't show listener on certain commands
- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- some way to not have previous definitions from a source file
  clutter the namespace
- finish ExternalFactor VocabularyLookup
- fedit broken with listener
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:

+ kernel:

- dissolve library/platform/native/
- profiler is inaccurate: wrong word on cs
- better i/o scheduler
- >lower, >upper for strings
- don't rehash strings on every startup
- remove sbufs
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- first-class hashtables
- hash words in stage 2 of bootstrap
- rewrite accessors and mutators in Factor, with slot/set-slot primitive
- replace -export-dynamic with sundry-xt
- add a socket timeout

+ misc:

- alist -vs- assoc terminology
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- command line parsing cleanup
- nicer way to combine two paths
- :get &get
- namestack, catchstack lists
- OOP
- room. prints code heap size
- refactor sort
- ditch object paths
- browser responder for word links in HTTPd; inspect responder for
  objects
- use keep instead of tuck, try to remove usages of transp
- worddef props
- prettyprint: when unparse called due to recursion, write a link
- prettyprinter should output {{ ... }} syntax for hashtables
- FORGET: and forget

+ httpd:

- log with date
- basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
- file responder; last-modified field
