72/73:

- keep a list of getter/setter words
- default constructor
- move tuple to generic vocab
- update plugin docs
- extract word keeps indent
- word preview for remote words
- support USING:
- special completion for USE:/IN:
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- if gadgets are moved, added or deleted, update hand.
- keyboard focus
- keyboard gestures
- text fields
- code gc
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- print warning on null class
- optimize away dispatch
- layouts with gaps
- alignment of gadgets inside their bounding boxes needs thought
- WordPreview calls markTokens() -> NPE
- faster completion
- ppc register decls
- rename f* words to stream-*

- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- slot compile problem
- sdl console crash
- x86 register decl

+ compiler/ffi:

- value type structs
- out parameters
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o

+ kernel:

- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- generational gc
- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- worddef props
