+ compiler:

- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- more accurate type inference in some cases
- optimize away dispatch
- goal: to compile hash* optimally
- type check/not-check entry points for compiled words
- getenv/setenv: if literal arg, compile as a load/store

+ oop:

- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes

+ ffi:

- figure out how to load an image referring to missing libraries
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ listener/plugin:

- update plugin docs
- extract word puts stuff in the wrong place
- extract word keeps indent
- word preview for remote words
- WordPreview calls markTokens() -> NPE
- listener should be multithreaded
- compile all commands
- faster completion
- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- rename f* words to stream-*
- <file[bc][rw]> is badly named -- <file-reader>, <file-writer>

+ kernel:

- ppc register decls
- do partial objects cause problems?
- remove sbufs
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- first-class hashtables

+ misc:

- perhaps /i should work with all numbers
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- browser responder for word links in HTTPd
- worddef props
- prettyprint: when unparse called due to recursion, write a link

+ httpd:

- log with date
- file responder; last-modified field
