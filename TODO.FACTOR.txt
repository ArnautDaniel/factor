- prettyprint-1
- {...} vectors
- better .s
- parsing should be parsing
- telnetd: listening on a socket
- vocab inspecting ==> worddef>list, assumes . on a list works
- need hashtable inspection too
- describe-word
- clone-sbuf
- contains ==> contains?
- telnetd: send errors on socket
- native 'see'

+ native:

- partition, sort
- inspector: sort

+ interactive:

- words. should output in a nicer form
- inspector links when describe called without object path
- 'cascading' styles

+ math:

- FactorLib.equal() not very good
- IN: format base: work with all types of numbers

+ listener:

- link style lingers
- back space then type: input style gone
- fedit broken with listener
- press enter in the middle of a line
- print-numbered-list
- new-listener shouldn't suspend continuation in current listener

+ compiler:

- tail call optimization broken again
- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.

+ misc:

- should i -i inf -inf be parsing words?
- fix multithreading
- errors at startup not handled properly
- namespace clone drops static var bindings
- ditch map
- ditch expand
- set-object-path
- more readable traces

+ httpd:

- use catch
- httpd: don't flush so much
- log with date
- log user agent
- add a socket timeout
- if a directory is requested and URL does not end with /, redirect
- return more header fields, like Content-Length, Last-Modified, and so on
- HEAD request
- basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
