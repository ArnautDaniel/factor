- input style after clicking link
- fedit broken with listener
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- enforce bottom-up in native bootstrap
- fix up native file/line info
- standalone listener input style
- add a socket timeout
- drop test in http server
- jedit bug? +line doesn't always work when switching into an existing
  buffer with a remembered first line
- completion: enter no good
- completion: don't show automatically
- balance needs USE:
- postpone errors until actual read/write op
- command line arguments
- socket protocol

+ docs:

- vector-each/map examples
- unparse examples
- finish second practical
- sbuf-hashcode
- vector-hashcode
- review doc formatting with latex2html
- recursion -vs- iteration in vectors chapter

+ tests:

- java factor: equal numbers have non-equal hashcodes!
- FactorLib.equal() not very good
- do nset-nth, nremove-nth, nsubstitute, ninject
- IN: format base: work with all types of numbers

+ listener/plugin:

- auto insert USE:
- plugin not unloaded
- listener backspace overzealous
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:
- inspector links when describe called without object path

+ native:

- gc call in the middle of some ops might affect callstack
- multitasking
- parsing should be parsing
- better error reporting

+ JVM compiler:

- compiled stack traces broken
- save classes to disk
- tail call optimization broken again
- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.

+ misc:

- rethink strhead/strtail&co
- namespace clone drops static var bindings
- ditch map
- ditch expand
- set-object-path
- more readable traces
- 'cascading' styles
- telnetd: send errors on socket
- contains ==> contains?

+ httpd:

- file responder:
  - port to native
  - if a directory is requested and URL does not end with /, redirect
- if user clicks stop in browser, doesn't stop sending?
- log with date
- return more header fields, like Content-Length, Last-Modified, and so on
- HEAD request
- basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
