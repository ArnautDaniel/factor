+ 0.85:

- words:
  - S+left: reload
  - S+right: inspect

- links:
  - same deal

- UI dataflow visualizer:
  - spacing is weird
  - #label, #if mess up height
  - [ >r + dup r> ] foo  broken
  - why does + look funny?
- pane output in UI should use less memory
- signal 4 on datastack underflow on mac intel??
- faster I/O
- buffer-ptr should be an alien
- faster Unix stream-read#
- fix this:
  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113

- prettier printing of hashtable literals, alists, cond, ...
- more compact relocation info
- problem if major gc happens during relocation
  - in fact relocation should not cons at all
- we need to optimize  [ dup array? [ array? ] [ array? ] if ]
- better way of dealing with compiler errors
- track individual method usages
- variable width word wrap
- add-gadget, model-changed, set-model should compile
- graphical module manager tool
- editor:
  - only redraw visible lines
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
  - write "foo| " and put caret at | then select word element: selects
    space
- we have trouble drawing rectangles
- ui browser: show currently selected vocab & words

- doc sweep
- tool help
- perhaps commands window should sort by gesture
- merge keyboard help with help in some way
- keyboard help: hide commands whose gestures are shadowed
- division by zero may not raise an error -- document this

+ ui:

- draw-world: bail out if world is 0x0
- better help result ranking
- page scrolling should be timer-based too
- invoking interactor commands when interactor is busy -- still fucked
  because of grafting and ungrafting
- set-model set-model* and control-changed: its a hack, clean it up
- x11: scroll up/down wiggles caret
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- fix top level window positioning
- x11.app has a problem with A+ keys
- status bar showing number of words needing a recompile
- services do not launch if factor not running
- fix ui listener delay
- editor:
  - editor should support stream output protocol
  - double/triple click
  - autoscroll
  - undo and redo
  - transpose char/word/line
  - page up/down
  - search and replace
- slider needs to be modelized
- fonts/ should go inside the .app -- we need multi-tier resource-path
- should be possible to drop an image file on the .app to run it
- support x11's large selections, if needed
- own-selection violates ICCCM
- cocoa: windows are not updated while resizing
- grid slows down with 2000 lines
- ui uses too much cpu time idling
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- x11 title bars are funny
- rollover is not updated on window focus changes
- x11 input methods
- cocoa:
  - horizontal wheel scrolling
  - polish OS X menu bar code
- structure editor

+ module system:

- F7: friendlier error if file deleted
- convention for main entry point of a module
- track a list of assets loaded from each module's file
- generic 'define ( asset def -- )'
- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- file out

+ compiler/ffi:

- stdcall callbacks
- see if alien calls can be made faster
- [ r> ] infer should throw an inference error
- compiler tests are not as reliable now because of try-compile usage
  - we can just do [ t ] [ \ foo compiled? ] unit-test
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- callstack overflow when compiling mutually recursive inline words
- test what is done in the case of an invalid declaration on an inline
  recursive
- ppc64 backend
- arm backend
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- C functions returning structs by value
- code gc
- infer which variables are read, written in a quotation
- compiled continuations
- compiled call traces

+ misc:

- swap nappend ==> nappend
- sometimes darcs get fails with the httpd
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- factorcode httpd crashed: bad file descriptor
- growable data heap
- incremental GC
- UDP
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch

+ httpd:

- help responder has no way to access { "foo" "bar" }
- httpd search tools
- remaining HTML issues need fixing
