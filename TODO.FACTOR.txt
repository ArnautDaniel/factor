+ 0.83:

- windows port from erg
- why aren't some cocoa words compiled?
- editor:
  - delegation issue with fields and interactors
  - multi-line inserts
  - scroll to caret
  - only redraw visible lines
  - bug after removing all lines
  - word-at-a-time commands
  - deleting words, lines
  - better listener multi-line expression handling
  - stack display: trim at 32 columns
- shift modifier not delivered
- x11 copy to clipboard
  
- httpd search tools
- remaining HTML issues need fixing

+ io:

- unix i/o: problems with passing f to syscalls
- factorcode httpd started using 99% CPU, but still received connections;
  closing read-fds solved it
- sometimes darcs get fails with the httpd
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- "localhost" 50 <client> won't fail

+ ui:

[2:45pm] tathi: Factor's text display is a bit odd sometimes, until you mouse over (or click, if there's no "live" text)
[2:48pm] tathi: it appears to be using the font metrics from the sprite tuple, but re-using the texture from the previous letter
[2:59pm] tathi: hmm...and it looks like it's only be happening the first time you use a given character (from a given font face)
- make-frame should compile
- editor:
  - undo and redo
  - transpose char/word/line
  - autoscroll
  - page up/down
  - search and replace
- finish gui stepper
- windows are not updated while resizing
- graphical module manager tool
- add some handy services:
  - base conversion
  - search help for selection
- make factor a services client
- services do not launch if factor not running
- grid slows down with 2000 lines
- integrated error documentation
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- 'show' doesn't work if invoked from a listener on an object which is
  itself inspected in the listener
- ui uses too much cpu time idling
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- x11 title bars are funny
- fix top level window positioning
- prettyprinter's highlighting of non-leaves doesn't really work
- rollover is not updated on window focus changes
- x11 input methods
- new browser:
  - browse generic words and classes
  - need actions for reloading the source file and opening word in jEdit
  - highlight showing panes in originating list
- reimplement tab completion
- cocoa:
  - horizontal wheel scrolling
  - polish OS X menu bar code
- variable width word wrap
- slider needs to be modelized

+ compiler/ffi:

- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- see if alien calls can be made faster
- faster sequence= for UI
- fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too
- constant branch folding
- type inference at branch merge points
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- remove literal table
- C functions returning structs by value
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- code gc

+ misc:

- consider: swap tail --> tail, swap head --> head
- mach_signal: fault address reporting is not reliable
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch
- fix this:

  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 
]

- code walker & exceptions -- test and debug problems
- break: perhaps use current stdio to run break listener
