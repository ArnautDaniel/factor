<magnus--> not *too* long
<magnus--> but we'd need to longjmp the main thread from the exception handler thread
<magnus--> or cause a signal in the main thread

- single-stepper and variable access: wrong namespace?
- investigate if COPYING_GEN needs a fix
- faster layout
- add a socket timeout
- keep alive
- sleep word
- redo new compiler backend for PowerPC
- fix i/o on generic x86/ppc unix
- alien primitives need a more general input type
- 2map slow with lists
- nappend: instead of using push, enlarge the sequence with set-length
  then add set the elements with set-nth
- faster sequence operations
- generic some? all? memq? fiber?
- index and index* are very slow with lists
- code walker & exceptions
- if two tasks write to a unix stream, the buffer can overflow
- rename prettyprint* to pprint, prettyprint to pp
- reader syntax for arrays, byte arrays, displaced aliens
- dipping seq-2nmap, seq-2each
- array sort
- images saved from plugin do not work
- generic skip
- inference needs to be more robust with heavily recursive code
- investigate orphans

+ plugin:

- word preview for parsing words
- plugin: supportsBackspace
- if external factor is down, don't add tons of random shit to the       
  dictionary

+ ui:

- tiled window manager
- faster repaint
- console with presentations
- ui browser
- auto-updating inspector, mirrors abstraction
- mouse enter onto overlapping with interior, but not child, gadget
- rollovers broken in inspector
- menu dragging
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- frame gap

+ ffi:

- smarter out parameter handling
- clarify powerpc passing of value struct parameters
- box/unbox_signed/unsigned_8
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- value type structs
- bitfields in C structs
- setting struct members that are not *

+ compiler:

- simplifier:
  - kill tag-fixnum/untag-fixnum
  - kill replace after a peek
  - merge inc-d's across VOPs that don't touch the stack
- [ EAX 0 ] --> [ EAX ]
- intrinsic char-slot set-char-slot integer-slot set-integer-slot
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- re-introduce #target-label => #target optimization

+ sequences

- specialized arrays
- list map, subset: not tail recursive
- phase out sbuf-append

+ kernel:

- delegating generic words with a non-standard picker
- powerpc has weird callstack residue
- instances: do not use make-list
- unions containing tuples do not work properly
- method doc strings
- clean up metaclasses
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- code gc
- doc comments of generics
- M: object should not inhibit delegation
- renumber types appopriately

+ i/o:

- faster stream-copy
- reading and writing byte arrays
- merge unix and win32 io where appropriate
- unix io: handle \n\r and \n\0
- separate words for writing characters and strings
- perhaps:
  GENERIC: set-style ( style stream -- )
  GENERIC: stream-write
  GENERIC: stream-write-char
- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- unify unparse and prettyprint
- utf16, utf8 encoding

+ nice to have libraries:

- regexps
- XML
- real Unicode support (strings are already 16 bits and can be extended
  to 21 if the need arises, but we need full character classification
  predicates, comparison, case conversion, sorting...)
- full Win32 binding
- Cairo binding
