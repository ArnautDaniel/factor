+ plugin:

- update plugin docs
- word preview for remote words
- faster completion

+ ui:

- scrollable inspector
- inspector needs prettier nesting
- <titled> needs to look better
- enforce inspector uniqueness
- auto-updating inspector
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- fix up initial layout of slider
- console: scroll to bottom
- caret clip
- split preferred size and layouting
- remove shelf/pile duplication
- menus
- opaque widgets
- layered gadget
- resizing and moving gadgets interactively with halo on top of gadget
- hand clip

+ compiler/ffi:

- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- redo partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- dataflow optimizer needs eq not =
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- value type structs
- out parameters
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o

+ kernel:

- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- code gc
- generational gc
- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- worddef props
- automatically recompiling defs
