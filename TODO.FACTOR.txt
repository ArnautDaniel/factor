+ plugin:

- update plugin docs
- word preview for remote words
- faster completion

+ ui:

- single-pixel shuffle
- resizing a gadget should probably relayout children
- resizing: drag relative to initial click pos
- mouse enter onto overlapping with interior, but not child, gadget
- menu dragging
- auto-updating inspector
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- faster layout
- faster repaint
- check broken
- frame gap

+ compiler/ffi:

- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- redo partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- dataflow optimizer needs eq not =
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- value type structs
- out parameters
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o

+ kernel:

- powerpc has weird callstack residue
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- code gc
- generational gc
- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- worddef props
- automatically recompiling defs
