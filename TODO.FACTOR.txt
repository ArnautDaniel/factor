+ io:

- unix i/o: problems with passing f to syscalls
- factorcode httpd started using 99% CPU, but still received connections;
  closing read-fds solved it
- sometimes darcs get fails with the httpd
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- "localhost" 50 <client> won't fail

+ ui:

- "benchmark/help" runs out of memory
- shortcuts:
  - find a listener
  - find a browser
  - find a help window
  - they'll either focus such a window, or if the current window is of
    that type, cycle
- thumb min size
- support x11's large selections, if needed
- own-selection violates ICCCM
- one-column table doesn't need borders...?
- make-frame should compile
- editor:
  - undo and redo
  - transpose char/word/line
  - autoscroll
  - page up/down
  - search and replace
  - only redraw visible lines
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
  - editor should support stream output protocol
  - scroll to caret
  - better listener multi-line expression handling
  - history doesn't work in a good way if you ^K the input
  - history: move caret to end
- finish gui stepper
- cocoa: windows are not updated while resizing
- graphical module manager tool
- add some handy services:
  - base conversion
  - search help for selection
- make factor a services client
- services do not launch if factor not running
- grid slows down with 2000 lines
- integrated error documentation
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- 'show' doesn't work if invoked from a listener on an object which is
  itself inspected in the listener
- ui uses too much cpu time idling
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- x11 title bars are funny
- fix top level window positioning
- prettyprinter's highlighting of non-leaves doesn't really work
- rollover is not updated on window focus changes
- x11 input methods
- cocoa:
  - horizontal wheel scrolling
  - polish OS X menu bar code
- variable width word wrap
- slider needs to be modelized

+ module system:

- 'see' should show tuple constructors
- forgetting a class should remove its methods from all generic words
  - offer to remove generic words which are not called and have no
    methods
- forgetting a tuple class should forget the constructor
- seeing a tuple class should show the constructor
- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- see by itself only shows the G: def
- { class generic } see supports forms:
  { f generic } to show all methods
  { class f } to show all methods
- modularize core
- TUPLE: module files tests articles article main ;
- methods: remember their file/line
- { class generic } jedit, reload DTRT
- requesting a list of assets loaded from a specific file
- T{ link f "foo" "bar" } see
- T{ link f "foo" "bar" } jedit
- T{ link f "foo" "bar" } reload
- generic 'define ( asset def -- )'
- file out
- make 'forget' generic

+ compiler/ffi:

- nasty inference regressions
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- instead of decompiling words, add them to a 'recompile' set; compiler
  treats words in the recompile set as if they were not compiled
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- see if alien calls can be made faster
- faster sequence= for UI
- fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too
- constant branch folding
- type inference at branch merge points
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- remove literal table
- C functions returning structs by value
- code gc
- infer which variables are read, written in a quotation

+ misc:

- consider: swap tail --> tail, swap head --> head
- mach_signal: fault address reporting is not reliable
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch
- fix this:

  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 
]

- code walker & exceptions -- test and debug problems
- break: perhaps use current stdio to run break listener
- httpd search tools
- remaining HTML issues need fixing
