+ compiler:

- type inference fails with some assembler words
- more accurate type inference in some cases
- optimize away dispatch
- goal: to compile hash* optimally
- type check/not-check entry points for compiled words
- getenv/setenv: if literal arg, compile as a load/store

+ oop:

- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics

+ ffi:

- figure out how to load an image referring to missing libraries
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ listener/plugin:

- WordPreview calls markTokens() -> NPE
- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- listener should be multithreaded
- compile all, infer all commands
- faster completion
- errors don't always disappear
- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:

+ kernel:

- ppc register decls
- do partial objects cause problems?
- better i/o scheduler
- remove sbufs
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- first-class hashtables
- add a socket timeout

+ misc:

- perhaps /i should work with all numbers
- unit test weirdness: 2 lines appears at end
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- nicer way to combine two paths
- browser responder for word links in HTTPd
- worddef props
- prettyprint: when unparse called due to recursion, write a link

+ httpd:

- log with date
- file responder; last-modified field
