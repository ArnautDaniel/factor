- alist -vs- assoc terminology
- some way to run httpd from command line
- 'default responder' for when we go to root
- file responder:
  - directory listings
  - index.html
  - if a directory is requested and URL does not end with /, redirect
- doc strings with native factor

+ bignums:

- move some s48_ functions into bignum.c
- remove unused functions

- add a socket timeout
- >lower, >upper for strings
- telnetd should use multitasking
- accept multi-line input in listener

+ docs:

- logic
- numbers game leaves extra on the stack
- examples of assoc usage
- unparse examples, and difference from prettyprint
- review doc formatting with latex2html
- recursion -vs- iteration in vectors chapter, and combinator
  construction
- <% % %> and [, , ,] -- mention that % and , are usually in nested
  words
- object identity and equality - eq? and =
- finish namespaces docs
- mention word accessors/mutators
- to document:
  >r r> (earlier on?)
  continuations
  streams
  multitasking
  unit testing

+ tests:

- java factor: equal numbers have non-equal hashcodes!
- FactorLib.equal() not very good
- IN: format base: work with all types of numbers
- investigate mandel.factor

+ listener/plugin:

- plugin should not exit jEdit on fatal errors
- auto insert USE:
- balance needs USE:
- fedit broken with listener
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- input style after clicking link
- listener backspace overzealous
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:
- inspector links when describe called without object path

+ native:

- eliminate usage of long long
- is the profiler using correct stack depth?
- read1
- sbuf-hashcode
- vector-hashcode
- irc: stack underflow?
- gc call in the middle of some ops might affect callstack
- better i/o scheduler

+ JVM compiler:

- compiled stack traces broken
- save classes to disk
- tail call optimization broken again
- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.

+ misc:

- 'cascading' styles
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- rethink strhead/strtail&co
- namespace clone drops static var bindings
- ditch expand
- set-object-path

+ httpd:

- quit responder breaks with multithreading
- wiki responder:
  - port to native
  - text styles
- if user clicks stop in browser, doesn't stop sending?
- log with date
- return more header fields, like Content-Length, Last-Modified, and so on
- HEAD request
- basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
