73:

- update plugin docs
- word preview for remote words
- faster completion

- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- print warning on null class
- optimize away dispatch

- move tuple to generic vocab

- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- code gc
- ppc register decls

- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- extract word inside M:, C:, and structure browsing for these
- each-slot combinator
- references primitive
- fix completion invoke in middle of word
- don't hardcode so many colors
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- sdl console crash
- more accurate types for various words
- optimize out >array, >tuple, >hashtable etc
- write read: write should flush

+ compiler/ffi:

- value type structs
- out parameters
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o

+ kernel:

- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- generational gc
- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- worddef props
