- dec> bin> oct> hex> throw errors
- parse-number doesn't
- eval with multilien strings and #!
- redefining a word doesn't clear comments
- quit responder breaks with multithreading
- nicer way to combine two paths
- don't show listener on certain commands
- plugin should not exit jEdit on fatal errors
- wordpreview: don't show for string literals and comments
- alist -vs- assoc terminology
- write-icon kind of messy; " " should be output by the listener
- f usages. --> don't print all words
- file responder: don't show full path in title

- clean up listener's action popups
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- introduce ifte* and ?str-head/?str-tail where appropriate
- namespace clone drops static var bindings

+ bignums:

- move some s48_ functions into bignum.c
- remove unused functions

- add a socket timeout
- >lower, >upper for strings
- accept multi-line input in listener

+ docs:

- explain how log uses >polar and rect>
- when* unless*
- simple i/o section
- unparse examples, and difference from prettyprint
- review doc formatting with latex2html
- recursion -vs- iteration in vectors chapter, and combinator
  construction
- [, , ,] -- mention that , are usually in nested words
- finish namespaces docs
- mention word accessors/mutators
- to document:
  >r r> example
  continuations
  streams
  multitasking
  unit testing

+ tests:

- java factor: equal numbers have non-equal hashcodes!
- FactorLib.equal() not very good
- investigate mandel.factor

+ listener/plugin:

- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- some way to not have previous definitions from a source file
  clutter the namespace
- use inferior.factor for everything not just listener
- fedit broken with listener
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- input style after clicking link
- listener backspace overzealous
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:
- inspector links when describe called without object path

+ native:

- fix error postoning -- not all errors thrown by i/o code are
  postponed
- sbuf-hashcode
- vector-hashcode
- irc: stack underflow?
- gc call in the middle of some ops might affect callstack
- better i/o scheduler

+ JVM compiler:

- compiled stack traces broken
- save classes to disk
- tail call optimization broken again
- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.

+ misc:

- some way to run httpd from command line
- don't rehash strings on every startup
- 'cascading' styles
- ditch expand
- set-object-path

+ httpd:

- 'default responder' for when we go to root
- wiki responder:
  - port to native
  - text styles
- log with date
 basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
- file responder; last-modified field
