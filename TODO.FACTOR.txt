FFI:

- listener: use console shell api
- add a socket timeout
- fix error postoning -- not all errors thrown by i/o code are
  postponed
- quit responder breaks with multithreading

+ compiler/ffi:

- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- float types
- compile word twice; no more 'cannot compile' error!
- compiler: drop literal peephole optimization
- compiling when*
- compiling unless*
- getenv/setenv: if literal arg, compile as a load/store
- inline words
- perhaps /i should work with all numbers

+ docs:

- explain how log uses >polar and rect>
- simple i/o section
- unparse examples, and difference from prettyprint
- review doc formatting with latex2html
- recursion -vs- iteration in vectors chapter, and combinator
  construction
- [, , ,] -- mention that , are usually in nested words
- finish namespaces docs
- mention word accessors/mutators
- to document:
  continuations
  streams
  multitasking
  unit testing

+ listener/plugin:

- clean up listener's action popups
- accept multi-line input in listener
- don't show listener on certain commands
- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- some way to not have previous definitions from a source file
  clutter the namespace
- use inferior.factor for everything not just listener
- fedit broken with listener
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:
- inspector links when describe called without object path

+ kernel:

- profiler is inaccurate: wrong word on cs
- better i/o scheduler
- >lower, >upper for strings
- don't rehash strings on every startup

+ misc:

- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- 'cascading' styles
- command line parsing cleanup
- nicer way to combine two paths
- alist -vs- assoc terminology

+ httpd:

- wiki responder:
  - port to native
  - text styles
- log with date
 basic authentication, using httpdAuth function from a config file
- file responder; last-modified field

+ java factor is going away:

- compiled stack traces broken
- save classes to disk
- tail call optimization broken again
- don't compile inline words
- recursive words with code after ifte
- less unnecessary args to auxiliary methods
- inlining tail-recursive immediates
- direct stack access leaks memory on stack
- unnecessary local allocation: max is instance var, but several methods
  get compiled.
- ditch expand
- when* compilation in jvm
- plugin should not exit jEdit on fatal errors
- java factor: equal numbers have non-equal hashcodes!
- FactorLib.equal() not very good
