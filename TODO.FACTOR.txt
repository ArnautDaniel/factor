0.74:

- faster layout
- faster repaint
- forgotten words not removed from cross-reference
- implement fcopy
- win32 updates

- get all-tests to run with -no-compile
- if external factor is down, don't add tons of random shit to the dictionary
- scalar * matrix, vector * matrix, matrix * vector need to work
- turning vectors into row and column matrices
- make-matrix is slow and ugly
- move 2repeat somewhere else
- rotating cube demo

- plugin: extra space in stack effects
- plugin: type "re" in edit word dialog --> hang

+ ui:

- console with presentations
- ui browser
- auto-updating inspector, mirrors abstraction
- word preview for parsing words
- mouse enter onto overlapping with interior, but not child, gadget
- menu dragging
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- frame gap

+ ffi:

- clarify powerpc passing of value struct parameters
- char* struct members
- box/unbox_signed/unsigned_8
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- value type structs
- out parameter cleanup
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- setting struct members that are not *
- char[14], etc members -- generalize char255
- FFI float types

+ compiler:

- alien primitives need a more general input type
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- redo partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- dataflow optimizer needs eq not =
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- re-introduce #target-label => #target optimization

+ sequences

- 2map, sequence= slow with lists
- nappend: instead of using push, enlarge the sequence with set-length
  then add set the elements with set-nth
- ensure-capacity: don't be generic
- vector's ensure-capacity will crash if not given fixnums!
- dipping seq-2nmap, seq-2each
- remove seq- prefixes
- generic each some? all? member? memq? all=? top
  index? subseq?
- index and index* are very slow with lists
- list map, subset, project, append: not tail recursive
- phase out sbuf-append
- decide what to do with index-of
- GENERIC: map
  - list impl same as now

+ kernel:

- rename prettyprint to pprint
- powerpc has weird callstack residue
- .factor-rc loading errors are not reported properly
- instances: do not use make-list
- unions containing tuples do not work properly
- need G: combinations
- method doc strings
- code walker & exceptions
- string sub-primitives
- clean up metaclasses
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- code gc
- generational gc
- doc comments of generics
- M: object should not inhibit delegation

+ i/o:

- print [ foo ] car as \ foo
- printing f inside a list prints ...
- merge unix and win32 io where appropriate
- unix io: handle \n\r and \n\0
- reader syntax for arrays, byte arrays, displaced aliens
- separate words for writing characters and strings
- perhaps:
  GENERIC: set-style ( style stream -- )
  GENERIC: stream-write
  GENERIC: stream-write-char
- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- add a socket timeout
- renumber types appopriately
- unify unparse and prettyprint

+ nice to have libraries:

- regexps
- XML
- HTTP client
- real Unicode support (strings are already 16 bits and can be extended
  to 21 if the need arises, but we need full character classification
  predicates, comparison, case conversion, sorting...)
- full Win32 binding
- Cairo binding

+ httpd:

- virtual hosts
- keep alive
