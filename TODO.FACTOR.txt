+ inference/dataflow:

- type inference
- handle odd base cases, with code after ifte
- handle recursion with when, when* etc

+ compiler:

- slot compilation
- optimize away dispatch
- getenv/setenv: if literal arg, compile as a load/store
- assembler opcodes dispatch on operand types

+ oop:

- make see work with generics
- doc comments of generics
- redo traits with generic method map

+ ffi:

- figure out how to load an image referring to missing libraries
- is signed -vs- unsigned pointers an issue?
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ listener/plugin:

- faster completion
- sidekick: still parsing too much
- errors don't always disappear
- NPE in ErrorHighlight
- maple-like: press enter at old commands to evaluate there
- completion in the listener
- special completion for USE:/IN:

+ kernel:

- do partial objects cause problems?
- profiler is inaccurate: wrong word on cs
- better i/o scheduler
- remove sbufs
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- first-class hashtables
- add a socket timeout
- do transfer-word in fixup

+ misc:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- each-with map-with
- step: print NEXT word to execute, not word that JUST executed
- perhaps /i should work with all numbers
- unit test weirdness: 2 lines appears at end
- jedit ==> jedit-word, jedit takes a file name
- nicer way to combine two paths
- ditch object paths
- browser responder for word links in HTTPd
- worddef props
- prettyprint: when unparse called due to recursion, write a link

+ httpd:

- log with date
- file responder; last-modified field
