+ 0.84:

- RT_WORD should refer to XTs not word objects.
- fix contribs: boids, automata
- sometimes darcs get fails with the httpd
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- factorcode httpd crashed: bad file descriptor
- editor:
  - better listener multi-line expression handling
  - history doesn't work in a good way if you ^K the input
- services do not launch if factor not running
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- fix top level window positioning
- nasty inference regressions
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- graphical module manager tool
- see if alien calls can be made faster

========================================================================

+ ui:

- fix ui listener delay
- doc front page: document stack effect notation
- better doc for accumulate, link from tree
- we have trouble drawing rectangles
- the UI listener has a shitty design. perhaps it should not call out
  to the real listener.
- remaining walker tasks:
  - integrate walker with listener
  - <input> handled by walker itself
  - ^W in interactor
  - ^I in interactor
  - error handling is still screwy
  - continuation handling is also screwy
  - keyboard commands
- add-gadget, model-changed, set-model should compile
- shortcuts:
  - find a listener
  - find a browser
  - find a help window
  - they'll either focus such a window, or if the current window is of
    that type, cycle
- support x11's large selections, if needed
- own-selection violates ICCCM
- editor:
  - undo and redo
  - transpose char/word/line
  - autoscroll
  - page up/down
  - search and replace
  - only redraw visible lines
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
  - editor should support stream output protocol
- cocoa: windows are not updated while resizing
- grid slows down with 2000 lines
- ui uses too much cpu time idling
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- x11 title bars are funny
- rollover is not updated on window focus changes
- x11 input methods
- cocoa:
  - horizontal wheel scrolling
  - polish OS X menu bar code
- variable width word wrap
- slider needs to be modelized
- structure editor
- listener tab completion

+ module system:

- generic 'define ( asset def -- )'
- track individual method usages
- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- modularize core
- TUPLE: module files tests articles article main ;
- file out
- track module files and modification times, and a list of assets loaded
  from that file
- 'changes' word, asks if files changed on disk from loaded modules
  should be reloaded -- do this in the right order

+ compiler/ffi:

- more compact relocation info
- UI dataflow visualizer
- ppc64 backend
- we need to optimize  [ dup array? [ array? ] [ array? ] if ]
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- C functions returning structs by value
- code gc
- infer which variables are read, written in a quotation
- compiled continuations
- compiled call traces

+ misc:

- compiler tests are not as reliable now
- problem if major gc happens during relocation
  - in fact relocation should not cons at all
- growable data heap
- incremental GC
- UDP
- faster I/O
- buffer-ptr should be an alien
- faster Unix stream-read#
- EOF kills a port
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- hashed generic method dispatch
- fix this:

  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 
]

- httpd search tools
- remaining HTML issues need fixing
