+ plugin:

- word preview for remote words
- faster completion
- file properties for constructors, accessors/mutators, predicates
- set 'end' of artifacts/assets accurately

+ ui:

- mouse enter onto overlapping with interior, but not child, gadget
- menu dragging
- auto-updating inspector
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- faster layout
- faster repaint
- frame gap

+ compiler/ffi:

- mac os x ffi
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- redo partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- dataflow optimizer needs eq not =
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- value type structs
- out parameters
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ i/o:

- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- nicer way to combine two paths
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o

+ kernel:

- parse errors: in parser not debugger
- make-image: use a list not a vector
- powerpc has weird callstack residue
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- cat, reverse-cat primitives
- code gc
- generational gc
- make see work with union, builtin, predicate
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- automatically recompiling defs

+ slow data structures:

- vector-map, string-map, vector-each, string-each, vector-project:
  consing
- map, subset, project, append: not tail recursive
