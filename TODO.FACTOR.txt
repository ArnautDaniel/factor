- live search: timer delay would be nice
- hashed generic method dispatch
- fix this:
  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 ] .
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 113 
]
- prettier printing of hashtable literals, alists, cond, ...
- menu should stay up if mouse button released
- roundoff is still not quite right with tracks
- fix compiled gc check
  - there was a performance hit, investigate
  - float boxing and overflow checks need a gc check too
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- growable data heap
- documentation:
  - update module system docs

+ ui:

- grid displays quickly now, but constructing large amounts of gadgets
  is slow: eg, 10000 [ dup number>string ] map describe
- completion is not ideal: eg, C+e "buttons"
- some way of intercepting all gestures
- slider needs to be modelized
- better help result ranking
- help search looks funny
- variable width word wrap
- graphical module manager tool
- ui browser: show currently selected vocab & words
- auto-update browser and help when sources reload
- how do we refer to command shortcuts in the docs?
- fix top level window positioning
- editor:
  - autoscroll
  - transpose char/word/line
  - more efficient multi-line inserts
  - write "foo| " and put caret at | then select word element: selects
    space
- see if its possible to only repaint dirty regions
- structure editor

+ module system:

- track a list of assets loaded from each module's file
- C types should be words
  - TYPEDEF: float { ... } { ... } ;   ==> \ float T{ c-type ... } "c-type" swp
  - TYPEDEF: float FTFloat ;  ==> \ float \ FTFloat "c-type" swp
  - make typedef aliasing explicit
- seeing a C struct word should show its def
- file out

+ compiler/ffi:

- relocation should not cons at all
- stdcall callbacks
- callstack overflow when compiling mutually recursive inline words
- test what is done in the case of an invalid declaration on an inline
  recursive
- ppc64 backend
- arm backend
- mac intel: struct returns from objc methods
- float= doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- C functions returning structs by value
- infer which variables are read, written in a quotation
- compiled continuations
- compiled call traces

+ misc:

- minor GC takes too long now, we should card mark code heap
- buffer-ptr should be an alien
- swap nappend ==> nappend
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- incremental GC
- UDP
- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation

+ httpd:

- remaining HTML issues need fixing
