+ io:

- another i/o bug: on factorcode eventually all i/o times out
- gdb triggers 'mutliple i/o ops on port' error
- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- yield in a loop starves i/o

+ help:

- tools section needs updates
- method ordering and interpreter algorithm sections need updates
- document that can <void*> only be called with an alien
- help search
- fix remaining HTML stream issues
- automatically update help graph when adding/removing articles/words
- document conventions
- new turtle graphics tutorial
- better line spacing in ui and html
- tabular formatting - for inspector, changes and $values in help

- make the help look better, something like this:
  http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/darcs/OBSOLETE/factor/final.html

+ ui/help:

- new browser:
  - browse generic words and classes
  - initial size sucks
  - need actions for reloading the source file and opening word in jEdit
- toggle/radio buttons/tabs or something
- inspector: less clutter when browsing words
- make-frame should compile
- track:
  - don't allow negative dimensions
- fix top level window positioning
- changing window titles
- clicks sent twice
- speed up ideas:
  - only do clipping for certain gadgets
  - use glRect
- reimplement tab completion
- x11 input methods
- x11 title bars are funny
- cocoa:
  - need to flush callbacks
  - don't multiplex in the event loop if there is no pending i/o
  - horizontal scrolling
  - zooming doesn't work
  - implement handlers for open, quit events, and whatever else
  - polish OS X menu bar code
- when scrolling wheel, or moving mouse out of window, rollover is not
  updated
- focus is not top-level window aware
- display lists
- saving the image should save window configuration
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- variable width word wrap
- new gesture style

+ compiler/ffi:

- get factor running on mac intel
- free up r11, r12 as a vreg on ppc
- float= on powerpc doesn't consider nans equal
- intrinsic fixnum>float float>fixnum
- win64 port
- amd64 %unbox-struct
- constant branch folding
- complex float type
- complex float intrinsics
- remove literal table
- C functions returning structs by value
- FIELD: char key_vector[32];
- FIELD: union { char b[20]; short s[10]; long l[5]; } data;
- MEMBER: long pad[24];
- C structs: use new-style string mode parsing
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- code gc

+ misc:

- slice: if sequence or seq start is changed, abstraction violation
- make 3.4 bits>double an error
