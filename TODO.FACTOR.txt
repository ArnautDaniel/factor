- faster layout
- faster repaint
- linux/ppc and mac os x ffi
- stream server can hang because of exception handler limitations
- better i/o scheduler
- add a socket timeout
- unix ffi i/o
- powerpc has weird callstack residue
- make-vector and make-string should not need a reverse step
- console with presentations

+ plugin:

- extract word: if selection empty, move caret to new word after
- introduce quotation command
- set 'end' of artifacts/assets accurately

+ ui:

- ui browser
- auto-updating inspector
- word preview for parsing words
- mouse enter onto overlapping with interior, but not child, gadget
- menu dragging
- fix up the min thumb size hack
- frame gap

+ ffi:

- auto-generate box/unbox, and alien accessors
- box/unbox_signed/unsigned_8
- ffi unicode strings: null char security hole
- utf16 string boxing
- value type structs
- out parameters
- bitfields in C structs
- SDL_Rect** type
- struct membres that are not *
- FFI float types

+ compiler:

- alien primitives need a more general input type
- linux? bsd? words
- [ [ dup call ] dup call ] infer hangs
- more accurate types for various words
- declarations
- type inference fails with some assembler words;
  displaced, register and other predicates need to inherit from list
  not cons, and need stronger branch partial eval
- redo partial eval
- optimize away arithmetic dispatch
- dataflow optimizer needs eq not =
- the invalid recursion form case needs to be fixed, for inlines too
- #jump-f #jump-f-label
- re-introduce #target-label => #target optimization

+ sequences

- dipping seq-2nmap, seq-2each
- remove seq- prefixes
- seq-append --> nappend
- generic each some? all? member? memq? all=? top
  index? subseq?
- index and index* are very slow with lists
- list map, subset, project, append: not tail recursive
- : , sequence get push ; : % sequence get nappend ;
- phase out sbuf-append
- decide what to do with index-of
- GENERIC: map
  - list impl same as now
  - sequence impl: clone sequence and call nmap
  - string impl: string>sbuf nmap sbuf>string
- GENERIC: append
- list>vector --> >vector

+ kernel:

- instances: do not use make-list
- unions containing tuples do not work properly
- need G: combinations
- method doc strings
- make-image: use a list not a vector
- code walker & exceptions
- string sub-primitives
- clean up metaclasses
- unify unparse and prettyprint
- condition system with restarts
- nicer way to combine two paths
- vectors: ensure its ok with bignum indices
- code gc
- generational gc
- doc comments of generics
- proper ordering for classes

+ nice to have libraries:

- regexps
- XML
- HTTP client
- real Unicode support (strings are already 16 bits and can be extended
  to 21 if the need arises, but we need full character classification
  predicates, comparison, case conversion, sorting...)
- full Win32 binding
- Cairo binding

+ httpd:

- virtual hosts
- keep alive

+ matrix lib:

- scalar * matrix, vector * matrix, matrix * vector need to work
- turning vectors into row and column matrices
- make-matrix is slow and ugly
- move 2repeat somewhere else
